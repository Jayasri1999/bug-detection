The mobile gaming industry has seen tremendous growth over the years, and game development companies and individual game developers are always on the lookout for new insights into the market to guide their decision-making process. This project aims to provide a better understanding of the market situation by comparing and contrasting the popular games in the App Store and Play Store.

This project scrapes the popular apps from apple app store and google play store. Later, classified the app reviews into three categories: positive, negative, and bug reports using a machine learning model. The model will use a variety of machine learning techniques, including decision trees, clustering, and transformer models.

Benefits: The model will be able to provide app developers with insights into how users are feeling about their apps. This information can be used to improve the apps and make them more user-friendly.
